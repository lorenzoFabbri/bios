I am a PhD student at the Barcelona Institute for Global Health (ISGlobal).
My research interests focus on the use of transparent causal inference methods to answer questions in the broad field of Environmental Epidemiology.

I received my Bachelor’s degree in Biotechnology and my Master’s degree in Quantitative and Computational Biology.
