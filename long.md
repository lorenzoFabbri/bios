I am a PhD student at the Barcelona Institute for Global Health (ISGlobal).
I work under the supervision of Prof. [Martine Vrijheid](https://www.isglobal.org/en/our-team/-/profiles/18514).
My main topic of interest is the use of modern Causal Inference methods to answer questions in the broad field of Environmental Neuroepidemiology.

I received my Bachelor’s degree in Biotechnology and my Master’s degree in Quantitative and Computational Biology.
